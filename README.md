# i3-rice
Dotfiles and other saved configurations for my **(OLD)** i3-gaps rice.

## Programs I use in my rice
* [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3)
* [Polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar)
* [Termite](https://github.com/thestinger/termite)
* [Compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton)
* Zsh & [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
* [Rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi)
* [Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)
* [i3lock-fancy](https://github.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy)
* [maim](https://github.com/naelstrof/maim)

## Distro specific files
1. [Pacman](pacman) contains configs and hooks for use with pacman, which will only be useful on Arch Linux based distributions.

# Important note
[Install.sh](install.sh) is very, very broken and should not be used at all costs. I'm going to be repurposing some working snippets from it as individual scripts [in my new rice](https://github.com/amused-af/i3-rice).
